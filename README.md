--- Project Description ---

RatingProject is a project that fulfills one of my deepest dreams. It represents my approach to creating an application from scratch and, at the same time, provides an excellent opportunity to showcase my programming skills.

This application will evolve as the project progresses, fully demonstrating the extent of my capabilities. One of its main components will be the "Deadlines" screen, which will serve as a preview, allowing users to peek into the future and discover what's coming next for the application in the following weeks. The deadlines accompanying these previews will serve as evidence of my commitment and diligence in working on the project, always ensuring the timely delivery of solutions.

What exactly will this application be?
My goal is to explore all the possibilities offered by Flutter and create complex and appealing screens. I plan to create a "To-Do List" module, which will not only help users organize their tasks but also provide a preview of what's coming soon in the application.

Additionally, the project will include a module that fetches data from an external REST API. This module will introduce users to two exciting categories: "Artists" and "Podcasters." Each of these categories will take them into the world of the top 5 artists or podcasters in the current rankings. Users will be able to discover their episodes, music tracks, podcasts, and learn more about each of them through available details.

It's worth noting that the database used by the application is not real but generated by advanced artificial intelligence. These data will then be converted into JSON format and implemented in the application, creating an attractive and dynamic interface.

An essential part of the project will be the user login module. Initially, I will use a ready-made module from Firebase, but my long-term goal is to create a unique module tailored specifically to the needs of this application, showcasing my skills in authentication and user data management.

Last but not least, users will have the opportunity to interact with content, such as podcast episodes or music tracks. They can rate, comment, and share their opinions, creating an active community around the application.

All of these elements together paint a complete picture of the RatingProject, which is both a personal challenge for me and proof of my skills in the field of advanced mobile application development.

From time to time, there will be updates in this document to reflect what has changed in the application.
